/**
 * === Get The Line === 
 *
 *  Implement a function that acquires a line from the console and has this prototype:
 *
 *    int get_line(char dst[], int size)
 * 
 * Goals:
 *  - don't use scanf!
 *  - acquire a string up to the newline character
 *  - always put a null characher at the end of the buffer
 *  - truncate the acquisition to leave space at the end of the buffer for the null character
 *  - return the number of characters acquired, excluding the null character
 *  - implement a main loop that asks the user to insert a line, acquire it and print it
 *  - terminate the main loop when the user enters "END"
 *
